If the dataset and/or link no longer exists, please contact me at nathanling9730@gmail.com and I will send it to you accordingly.

The data used consists of nearly 50 years of loan data for American small businesses. The data was provided by Small Business Administration, a US government agency committed to helping small businesses propsper by connecting lenders with borrowers and assisting borrowers in successfully paying off their loans. 

The project consists of initial data cleaning, such as removing nonsensical values and converting the data to the proper format for analysis. 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is then conducted afterwards, which consists of understanding statistical trends and patterns. 
Afterwards, various machine learning models will be developed and tested, with the goal of predicting loan defaults for the various loans in the dataset. The best performing model will be selected.
Finally, the best performing model will be dissected to interpret what the model is doing and which factors are significant in predicting loan defaults.
