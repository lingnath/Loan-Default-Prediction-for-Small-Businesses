If the dataset and/or link no longer exists, please contact me at nathanling9730@gmail.com and I will send it to you accordingly.

The data used consists of nearly 50 years of loan data for American small businesses. The data was provided by Small Business Administration, a US government agency committed to helping small businesses propsper by connecting lenders with borrowers and assisting borrowers in successfully paying off their loans. 

In a high level, the project consists of the following steps:<br>
1. Initial data cleaning, such as removing nonsensical values and converting the data to the proper format for analysis.<br>
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), which consists of understanding statistical trends and patterns.<br>
3. Various machine learning models were developed and tested, with the goal of predicting loan defaults for the various loans in the dataset. The best performing model will be selected.<br>
4. The best performing model will be dissected to interpret what the model is doing and which factors are significant in predicting loan defaults.
